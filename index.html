      Charles Dickens
    </h4>
    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/3/2.mp3">
      Charles Dickens was born on 7th of February 1812 in Portsmouth, England. His father was a clerk, unfortunately, he was sent to jail for debts when Charles was just a little child.
    </p>
    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/3/3.mp3">
      Charles went to work at a blacking factory when he was 12, to earn money for his family. The harsh living conditions and the severe poverty Charles experienced, shaped his thoughts and beliefs. 
    </p>
    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/3/4.mp3">
      He received an average education, yet he struggled to teach himself immensely.
<br/>
      He managed to work as a parliamentary reporter in one of the newspapers.
    </p>
    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/3/5.mp3">
      In 1843, one of Dickens’ most famous works was published – 'A Christmas Carol'. In this story, it was particularly clear that Dickens was becoming increasingly disappointed with the social philosophy of his time

Dickens travelled abroad in the 1840s, first to America 
and then to Europe. A new stage in his life began. His 
novels were more serious and more carefully planned. 
‘David Copperfield’, published 1849-50, was similar to the 
story of Dickens’ own life.

      <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/5/2.mp3">
        Charles Dickens wrote a number of great novels, but David Copperfield was his favourite and portrayed his own life, and his miserable childhood after his father was imprisoned.
      </div>

      <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/5/3.mp3">
        The story revolves around a young boy under the care of his mother until he has his own family. David meets a lot of people as he grows up, studies, and works. Some people are very cruel to him.
      </div>

      <div class="tts  " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/5/4.mp3">
        But fortunately, he also meets some very nice people, who make his life happier. The main character is David Copperfield, who was born into an unfortunate family.
      </div>

      <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/5/5.mp3">
        He has been looked after by Peggotty, the servant of his family, Mr. Murdstone, his stepfather, and Betsy Trotwood, his aunt. He struggled a lot after the death of his mother.

      My Early Life
    </h3>
    <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/6/3.mp3">
      I am David Copperfield, and I was born in Blunderstone, Suffolk,. My father <strong>passed away </strong>  six months prior to my birth, so I never got the chance to know him. 
    </div>
    <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/6/4.mp3">
   My mother was rather young when 
she became a <strong> widow </strong>, and the only family I had left was Miss Betsey 
Trotwood, my father’s aunt. Unfortunately, Miss Trotwood held strong 
feelings against my father, having refused to see him after his marriage. 
    </div>
    <div class="tts  " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/6/5.mp3">
    She <strong> disapproved</strong>  of their union, as my mother, at the young age of 
nineteen, had married a man much older than her. Even though Greataunt Betsey Trotwood had never met my mother, she didn’t approve of 
the match and held onto her disapproval firmly.
    </div>
    <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/6/6.mp3">
      Great-aunt Betsey arrived one bright, windy March afternoon just 
before I was born. My mother was sitting by the fire, feeling very sad 
and alone when she looked up and saw a strange lady coming up the 
garden path. 
    </div>
    <div class="tts  " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/6/7.mp3">
     Although they had never met, my mother was certain that 
this was Miss Betsey Trotwood. This strange woman did not ring the 
bell like other visitors, but peered through the glass in the front door. 
    </div>
    <div class="tts  " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/6/8.mp3">
     My mother <strong>timidly </strong>  opened the door and Miss Betsey strode into the 
room, frowning as she looked around.
    </div>
    <div class="tts  " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/6/9.mp3">
      “Mrs. David Copperfield, I believe,” Miss Betsey said.
<br/>
      “Yes,” said my mother,  <strong>  faintly.</strong>
      <br/>
“Miss Trotwood,” said the visitor, introducing herself. “You have 
heard of me?”
    </div>
    <div class="tts  " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/6/10.mp3">
      My mother said that she had and invited Miss Betsey 
into the parlour. After they were seated my mother began to cry.

        <div class="tts  " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/6/11.mp3">
      “Take off your hat and let me see you,” demanded the visitor. “Why,

    <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/7/1.mp3">
      My mother was a young-looking woman but she hung her head, as if apologising for her youth. "I am <strong>trembling</strong>," cried my mother. "I don’t know what the matter is. I shall die, I’m sure I shall die! I’m so frightened" Miss Betsey poured my mother some tea and said, I intend to be godmother to your daughter. 
    </div>
        <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/7/2.mp3">
   I hope you’ll call her Betsey Trotwood 
Copperfield.” My mother tried to speak, but Miss Betsey stopped her.

    <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/7/3.mp3">
“Don’t contradict me; I have no doubt that your baby will be a girl.”

Miss Betsey asked about my mother’s life with my father.

    <div class="tts     " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/7/4.mp3">
      “We were very happy,” said my mother. “Mr. Copperfield was very good to me.”
    </div>
    <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/7/5.mp3">
      “He spoilt you, I suppose?” returned Miss Betsey. My mother began to sob again.

    </div>
    <div class="tts     " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/7/8.mp3">
      My mother nodded. “I was a nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to visit. He was very kind to me. He paid me a lot of attention. At last he proposed, I accepted and we were married,” said my mother.
    </div>
    <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/7/9.mp3">
      My great-aunt questioned my mother about her <strong>housekeeping</strong> skills. “I kept my <strong>housekeeping</strong>-book regularly and balanced it with Mr. Copperfield every night,” my mother sniffled.
    </div>
    <div class="tts   " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/7/10.mp3">
      “Well, well!” said Miss Betsey. “Don’t cry anymore. You’ll make yourself ill and that won’t be good either for any of us.”
    </div>
    <div class="tts     " data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/7/11.mp3">
      My mother dried her tears and explained that her husband had left her a security of one hundred and five pounds a year, which was just enough money to live on comfortably. Just then, our servant, Peggotty, came to light the candles and on seeing how ill my mother was, took her upstairs and sent her nephew to <strong>fetch</strong> the doctor.

“Madam,” said the doctor, “I thought you knew. The baby is a boy!”

My aunt did not speak. She put on her bonnet, walked out the door

                    My mother and Peggotty were so very different. Mother had pretty hair 
and a figure like a young girl, while Peggotty was shapeless. Her eyes 
were very dark and her cheeks and arms were hard and red.

                    One night Peggotty and I were sitting by the parlour fire waiting for 
my mother’s return. I was reading about crocodiles and was very tired.

                    I remembered he had 
walked home with us from church on Sunday. My mother bent down

                    Mother walked to the chair and held me in her arms. She <strong>caressed</strong> 
me, sobbing. “My own little Davy! Am I a nasty, selfish, <strong> cruel </strong> mother? 
I don’t love you at all, do I, Davy? Peggotty’s love is much better than 
mine, isn’t it?”

      I drifted off to sleep in her arms and thought no more about the matter until I saw the gentleman again a week later. He was in church and walked home with us after the service. 
    </p>
        <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/10/2.mp3">
     He accompanied us home 
from church on a few occasions but I still did not like him. I was jealous 
of him because I thought he was going to take my mother away from 
me. His name was Mr. Murdstone.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/10/3.mp3">
      It was one autumn morning and I was with my mother in the front garden when Mr. Murdstone came by on horseback. He said he was going to Lowestoft to see some friends who had a yacht. He offered to take me with him.
    </p>
    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/10/4.mp3">
      Peggotty cleaned me up and I soon sat in front of 
him on his horse trotting along on the green grass.
    </p>
    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/10/5.mp3">
      We went to a hotel by the sea where Mr. Murdstone met up with some friends. I was introduced to them and spent the afternoon with them. We rode home early in the evening.

        <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/10/6.mp3">
     It was a pleasant evening 
and my mother and Mr. Murdstone walked along the garden path. I 
watched from the kitchen window and ate my tea. When he was gone, 
my mother asked me about my day.
    </p>
        <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/10/7.mp3">
     I told her about Mr. Murdstone’s 
friends and then kissed her goodnight and went to my bed.

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/10/8.mp3">
      It was about two months after this trip to Lowestoft that I sat watching Peggotty sewing, when she suddenly said, “Master Davy, how would you like to come and spend a <strong>fortnight</strong> at my brother’s house in Yarmouth? You can see the sea and the boats and the ships. You can play with Ham on the beach.”
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/10/9.mp3">
      I knew that Ham was Peggotty’s nephew and I thought the visit would be a lot of fun, but I wondered what my mother would say. Peggotty said that my mother would be happy for me to go away for a little holiday as she was going to spend a <strong>fortnight</strong> with a neighbour.
    </p>

    <p class="tts" data-type="file" data-audio="./audio files/10/10.mp3">
      I woke up filled with excitement and dread as I thought that my mother would change her mind. Happily, I was wrong! The day dawned clear and bright and I was eager to leave home. I did not know that on my return everything would have changed. My mother kissed me.
    goodbye as I climbed onto the carrier’s cart. As I looked back and 
waved, I saw Mr. Murdstone by her side.

                The ride to Yarmouth was long and tiring. We ate from Peggotty’s 
picnic basket and slept a great deal from boredom. It was not until this 
trip that I realised Peggotty could <strong>snore </strong>  so much.

                When we arrived in Yarmouth I smelt the fish, the oakum, and the
tar. I saw the sailors getting ready to go out in their boats. Peggotty 
screamed, “Here’s my Ham!” Ham was a huge, strong man over six feet 
tall with round shoulders and curly light hair

                Ham shook my hand like we were old friends and lifted me onto his
back. He pointed to his house. In the distance I saw a black barge with 
an iron funnel sticking out of it. I could see nothing else.

              Ham said that it was. I was delighted at the thought of staying there. 
Their home was a real boat. It had a roof, a little door on the side and 
little windows. It was very clean inside and as tidy as possible, I saw 
some lockers and boxes, which were used for seats.

                Peggotty opened a

               The walls were whitewashed and the <strong> patchwork </strong> quilt made my eyes
ache with its brightness. One thing I noticed in this delightful house 
was the smell of fish. Peggotty told me that her brother dealt in lobsters, 
crabs and crawfish and that the smell was always in the house.

                A very polite woman in a crisp, white apron together with a beautiful

during dinner, I was introduced to Peggotty’s brother, Mr. Peggotty.

daughter. Mr. Peggotty had adopted Emily and Ham when they had

Gummidge, the widow of Mr. Peggotty’s partner. Even though Mr.

                One morning, a <strong>chimney sweep </strong>was walking past
                the workhouse when he saw the notice on the gate. The man
                <strong>owed</strong> a lot of money to his
                <strong>landlord</strong>, and he didn’t know how he was going
                to repay the debt.

                Mr. Gamfield, the chimney sweep, walked over to the gate and
                read the notice more closely. Perhaps this could be the answer
                to his debt problems, he thought to himself.

                It so happened that one of the board members who was standing
                nearby and watching the chimney sweep read the notice. He walked
                towards the stranger.

                When at last he was about to dip in his pen, he looked up and
                straight into Oliver’s face. It was full of fear and horror.

                Oliver climbed down the stairs into a <strong>damp</strong>,

                “Come with me; your bed is under the counter,” she said as she
                led the way upstairs. “You don’t mind sleeping in a

                and you’re under me. You will have to do what I tell you. Now

                For the next few months, Noah was <strong>cruel</strong> to

                granite milestone: London, seventy miles, the sign
                <strong>informed</strong> him. Oliver jumped to his feet,
                deciding to go to London. “Nobody will ever find me in London!”
                he said to himself.

                That day Oliver walked 20 miles eating only a crust of dry
                bread. The first night, he slept in a meadow under a haystack.
                Oliver awoke the next morning with the

                For the next six days, he slowly made his way towards London. He
                begged for food at small cottages in poor little villages.
                Oliver was so tired, and his feet hurt so much that he was
                practically crawling along the long, dirty road towards London.

                On the seventh day, he arrived at a small town. He sat on a
                doorstep, looking at his bleeding feet and clutching his empty
                stomach. The sun was beginning to rise up over the dirty houses,
                and the windows’ shutters were being taken off. A boy
                <strong> wandered </strong> past him and then wandered back.

                Although the boy was about the same age as Oliver, he had the
                manners of a man. He was short, about four feet six inches, but
                was dressed in a man’s clothes with a battered top hat on his
                head.

                Oliver struggled to his feet, <strong> wincing</strong> in
                <strong> agony </strong> each time his bleeding feet touched the
                pavement. The strange boy took Oliver to a nearby shop where he
                bought him some ham and a loaf of bread. Then he took him to a
                public house where he bought him a pot of beer.

                It was still a long way off and they didn’t arrive until after
                midnight. They came to the door of a strange-looking house,
                <strong> nestled </strong> in a narrow, unlit back street.
                Dodger gave a low whistle, and a man holding a candle came and

                Oliver woke late the next morning. He was alone in the room
                except for Fagin, who was cooking breakfast and drinking coffee.
                Oliver was not fully asleep and not fully awake—he was in that
                <strong>drowsy </strong>
                , in between state.

                Fagin called out Oliver’s name, but Oliver didn’t answer. The
                old man <strong> assumed</strong> the boy was still sleeping. He
                knelt down on the floor and <strong> pried up </strong> a piece
                of board. Underneath was a secret hiding place. He put his hands
                inside the hole and lifted out a small wooden box; this he put
                carefully on the table. Oliver watched this with his sleepy
                eyes.

                The old man sat down and opened the box. He took out a beautiful
                gold watch and chain. He held it lovingly and then gently
                replaced it in the box. He did this with several other items of
                jewellery. The old man’s eyes shined with pleasure as he looked
                at his glittering treasures.

                Fagin suddenly looked up and saw Oliver, whose eyes stared with
                <strong>curiosity. </strong>
                When the old man realized Oliver had seen his treasure, he
                closed the lid of the box with a loud crash and quickly grabbed
                a bread knife from the table.

                The boys <strong>cleared away</strong> the breakfast dishes, and
                then they started to play a strange game with Fagin. Oliver was
                puzzled as he watched them. Fagin put a watch in his waistcoat
                pocket, a snuffbox in one of his trousers’ pockets and a
                pocketbook in the other pocket. He pushed a fake-diamond pin
                into his shirt, pulled his coat tightly around himself and
                walked around the room with a walking stick. He looked around
                the room, at the doors and the fireplace, like they were shop
                windows. Every now and again, he stopped and looked around, as
                if he were afraid of thieves. He checked his pockets to make
                sure everything was still there.

                bookshop, very much <strong>occupied with</strong> a book he had
                picked from the shelf. He didn’t notice the boys moving around
                outside the shop. Oliver watched in horror as Dodger slid his
                hand into the gentleman’s pocket, pulled out a handkerchief, and
                passed it to Charlie. The two boys began to run quickly away,
                but Oliver stood frozen to the spot. In a flash, the
                <strong>mystery</strong> of the hidden watches, the
                handkerchiefs, the games and the old man was clear to Oliver.
                When he realized what was happening, he ran away as fast as he
                could.

                The old gentleman put down his book and put his hand in his
                pocket, searching for his handkerchief. When he found that it
                was no longer in his pocket, his eyes turned to Oliver, who was
                running away. The gentleman naturally assumed that Oliver was
                the thief and, running after the boy, he called out: “Stop
                thief! Stop thief!”

                Dodger and Charlie turned around to see who was chasing them.
                When they realized that it was Oliver being chased and not them,
                they stopped running and started shouting: “Stop thief! Stop
                thief!”

                The cry was taken up by a hundred people as the chase was on.
                From some place, a blow came across his face, and he went down
                on the hard, muddy street.

                Yes, I am afraid it is,” came the old gentleman’s voice. “Poor
                <strong>fellow</strong> He has hurt himself.” The gentleman
                looked sadly down at Oliver.

                A police officer pushed his way through the crowd, seized Oliver
                by the collar and pulled him up to his feet. “Come on, get up,”
                said the officer.

                The old gentleman and Oliver were taken quickly to the

                <strong> temper.</strong> The old gentleman put his business
                card on the magistrate’s desk, bowed, and said, “That’s my name
                and address, sir.” But Mr. Fang

                The gentleman was surprised at the question. He pointed to his

                Mr. Brownlow’s temper was tested, but he considered that he’d

                Mr. Fang sat silently for a few moments then turned to Mr.
                Brownlow. “Do you mean to state your complaint against this boy
                or not? If you do not give <strong> evidence, </strong> I will
                punish you for disrespecting the court.”

                Eventually, after many more interruptions from Mr. Fang, Mr.
                Brownlow managed to explain what had happened. He explained that
                in the shock of the events, he had chased after the boy because
                he saw him running away. He asked the magistrate to deal with
                the boy kindly.

                Oliver tried to speak but he could not find his voice. The room
                seemed to spin around and his head felt dizzy. The policeman,
                being a kind man and seeing Oliver’s pale face, answered the
                magistrate’s questions and told him that he, too, thought Oliver
                was quite ill.

                Mr. Brownlow saw that Oliver was looking even more ill and
                decided to take him to his own home. Oliver slept for many days
                in a high fever, and looked after with kindness he had never
                known. When at last he awoke, he was very weak and didn’t know

                I think I would rather read them, sir,” replied Oliver quietly.
                He didn’t want to tell the kind gentleman that he could not
                write.

                Mr. Brownlow told Oliver that he wanted to talk to him about a

                “I feel I can trust you,” said the gentleman. “I know you are an
                orphan without a friend in the world. I have made
                <strong>inquiries </strong> about you, but I would like you to

                Mr. Brownlow sat quietly as Oliver told his sad story. In the
                middle of the storytelling, they were interrupted by the arrival
                of Mr. Grimwig, a friend of Mr. Brownlow’s.

                Mr. Grimwing was a stout old gentleman. He walked with the help
                of a large cane. Mr. Brownlow explained who Oliver was and the
                <strong>circumstances </strong>
                which made the young boy live with him. As Oliver went
                downstairs to inform Mrs. Bedwin that they were ready for tea,
                Mr. Grimwig looked at him suspiciously.

                “Where does the boy come from?” asked Mr. Grimwig. “So, he’s had
                a fever. What of that? Having fever isn’t a sign of goodness.
                What do you know of him?”

                “A little,” replied Mr. Brownlow. “I have had Oliver
                <strong> investigated. </strong> and he was telling me his tale
                when you arrived.”

                The conversation stopped when Mrs. Bedwin arrived with the tea
                tray. The two gentlemen and Oliver sat together and drank tea
                and ate homemade ginger cake. Oliver was sitting down to his
                second slice of cake when Mrs. Bedwin brought in a small parcel
                of books, which had just been delivered by a shop-boy.

                It was agreed that Nancy should be the one to fetch Oliver the

                The next morning, Fagin informed Oliver that he was to go to
                Bill’s house that evening, and he would only come back when he
                had ‘worked for his supper’. He said that he could return when

                That evening, Fagin gave Oliver a book and a candle to read by
                while he waited for Nancy to arrive. The book was about crime
                and criminals. Terrible crimes were described in great detail
                and Oliver’s blood went cold as he read. Fear came over him and
                he threw the book <strong>aside</strong>. Falling to his knees,
                he prayed that he would not become a part of such terrible
                <strong>deeds</strong>, and that he would be saved from danger.

                He heard a <strong>faint</strong> sound from outside. “Who’s
                there?” he called out. “It’s me, Oliver. It’s Nancy.” Nancy came
                inside and fell into a chair and looked at Oliver. He noticed
                that she looked very pale. “God forgive me! I never dreamt of
                this,” she said, shaking with cold. She rocked herself
                <strong>to and fro</strong>, beating upon her knees with her
                fists.

                The two robbers held Oliver between them as they left the house
                and disappeared into the darkness and <strong>mist</strong>.
                They crossed a small bridge into the town of Chertsey and
                stopped by a high wall surrounding a large house. Toby climbed
                over the wall, and Sikes lifted Oliver up and helped him over to
                where Toby waited. Sikes followed closely behind. The three of
                them lay on the grass as they caught their breath. Oliver looked
                around him and realized what the two men needed from him—that he
                was needed to <strong>partake</strong> in a
                <strong>housebreaking</strong>, robbery and possibly murder. A
                cold sweat came over him, and he fell to his knees.

                “Get up!” demanded Sikes. “Or the earth will be covered in your
                brains.” Oliver gathered his strength and rose to his feet.
                “Please let me go,” he cried. “Let me run away and die in the
                fields. I will never come near London again. Don’t make me

                Sikes would have fired the pistol but Toby knocked it from his
                hand. “Hush,” Toby whispered to Oliver. “Say another word and
                I’ll knock you down with a crack on the head. It’s quieter than
                a gunshot but does the same job.”

                They crept around to the back of the house, and Bill forced open
                a shutter. Behind it was a little window. Bill silently pulled
                the window open and shined the lantern in Oliver’s face. “Now

                Oliver nodded. “Yes,” he said quietly. A moment, later .Oliver
                decided that he would warn the family about the robbery. He
                started slowly down the little passage when he heard Bill shout:

                Oliver was frightened by the cry and let the lantern fall to the
                floor with a crash. Immediately a light appeared at the top of
                the stairs, and Oliver saw two frightened men peering around the
                doorway. Suddenly there was a flash, a bang, smoke and a crash
                somewhere.

                Sikes was behind Oliver, grabbing him by the collar as the smoke
                cleared away. Bill fired his pistol at the men as he ran to the
                window, dragging Oliver behind him. Oliver heard a loud bell
                ringing, the noise of gunfire and the shouts of men. He
                <strong>sensed</strong> he was being carried away quickly. He
                felt sick and cold, then all went dark and he heard nothing.

                Not far from the house, Bill dropped Oliver into a dry
                <strong>ditch</strong>. Oliver was bleeding heavily. Bill could
                hear men shouting in the distance and the sound of barking dogs
                as they made their way closer. He took another look at Oliver,
                jumped out of the ditch and ran into the night leaving Oliver
                behind.

                Three men stopped to listen. They called back the dogs and the
                air went suddenly silent. The three pursuers gathered together
                to discuss their plan of action. Two of the men were servants in
                the big house; the third man was a <strong>tinker</strong> who
                had joined in the chase when he heard the commotion. They were

                Oliver lay unconscious in the ditch, feeling nothing as the rain
                beat down on him. As dawn broke over him he awoke, shivering in
                cold and pain. The bleeding had stopped, but his left arm hung
                useless at his side. He climbed painfully out of the ditch and
                staggered towards a narrow road. In the distance, he saw a house
                and slowly walked towards it. He carefully climbed the steps,
                knocked faintly on the door and collapsed against the doorway.

                Inside, the three men, who had chased the
                <strong>intruders</strong> in the night, sat in the warm
                kitchen, where they told their tale to both the cook and the
                housemaid. Of course, to make the tale more interesting to the
                two females, Mr. Giles—the servant—exaggerated the facts so that
                he and his colleague, Mr. Brittles, looked like heroes.

                said, as he looked at the pale, frightened faces around him at
                the table. Mr. Giles looked quite pale as well. “But the door

                None of the party made any moves toward the door. After much
                discussion Mr. Brittles agreed to open the door, but only with
                Mr. Giles and the tinker as witnesses. They went upstairs to the
                front door. The two women didn’t want to be left behind so they
                followed the men, talking very loudly to make it seem that there
                were more people in the house than there really were. Mr. Giles
                told the others to pinch the dogs’ tails so as to make them bark
                <strong>viciously</strong>. As Mr. Brittles opened the door, the
                four other members of the welcoming committee looked over his
                shoulder to see who had disturbed their breakfast. What they saw
                was an <strong>exhausted</strong>, injured David Copperfield.

                He looked from face to face, searching for someone. Finally

                In the early evening, Oliver recovered enough to tell them his
                life history. He was weak and in pain, and his voice was feeble.
                At times he had to stop for rest, as he told of the
                <strong>misfortunes</strong> and evils that cruel men had
                brought upon him. He narrated his story as best he could, before
                falling into a gentle sleep.

                Mrs. Maylie arranged for Oliver to be taught by an old gentleman

                sit under a shady tree, and Rose would read aloud to them.

                Mr. Bumble was now married and master of the workhouse. One
                morning, after yet another quarrel with his wife, he left the
                workhouse feeling terrible and walked the streets. It was
                beginning to rain so he sought shelter in a tavern. He looked
                through the dusty window and saw that the parlour was deserted,
                except for one customer. Mr. Bumble decided to enter the tavern
                for a little refreshment while he waited for the rain to stop.

                After ordering a drink from the landlord, he passed through the
                bar and into the little parlour. The lonely customer was sitting
                at a small table, bending over his drink. Mr. Bumble muttered a
                greeting as he passed the man, but there was no reply.

                was by hearing him speak about this place that I found out where
                you are. Some time ago, soon after Oliver was put into your

                <strong> overheard</strong> a conversation between Monks and
                Fagin. I found out that Monks had seen Oliver with two of our
                boys on the day we first lost him, and that he had recognized
                him as the same child that he was watching for, though I
                couldn’t make out why. Monks promised Fagin money if Oliver was
                got back, and he was to be paid more to have Oliver made into a
                thief.”

                Nancy pleaded with him to let her go out if only for an hour,
                but he threw her into a chair and held her forcibly while she
                struggled’ trying to get away from his grip. When she heard the
                clock strike twelve, she gave up the struggle. She was left in
                the chair as Sikes joined Fagin.

                As Fagin’ walked home in the early hours of the morning, he
                thought about Nancy’s strange behaviour. It seemed odd that she
                would be so impatient to leave home at eleven o’clock, only to
                give up the struggle at exactly twelve o’clock. He thought that
                maybe Nancy had found a new friend and was going to leave Bill.
                A new friend of Nancy’s would be valuable to Fagin, so he
                decided to have her watched.

                The following Sunday night, the church clock struck
                quarter-to-twelve as two <strong>figures</strong> appeared on
                London Bridge. One was a woman who was looking about, as if in
                search of something. The other figure walked in the shadows, not
                wanting to be seen as he followed the woman. When she reached
                the other side of the bridge, the woman looked around her again.
                There was no sign of anyone else there so she turned back. Her
                shadow stopped and turned back as well.

                The shadow saw a young lady and an older gentleman climb out of
                a carriage and then <strong>dismiss</strong> it. They walked
                towards the bridge. Nancy saw them and ran to join them. She
                pointed to the steps and said that she would speak to them
                there. The shadow watched them, hidden in the shadows, and had
                to pull himself back as they stopped in front of him

                description. We shall see. Many people are extraordinarily like
                each other. It may not be the same man. Now young woman, you

                it. What can I do for you?” “Nothing, sir,” replied Nancy,

                The kind man offered to send Nancy away from London, to the
                country, but Nancy shook her head. “But we can take you
                someplace where you’ll be safe, either in England or in some
                other country.” Rose pleaded with Nancy to accept the

                Yes, it is, was his reply. “Get up,” he said again as he threw

                clothes. Some

                <strong> public-house </strong>
                in a small village. There were some villagers quietly drinking
                their ale before the fire. They made room for the stranger but
                he ignored them and sat alone, except for his dog, in the
                farthest corner of the room. He ordered food and drink, which he
                shared with Bull’s-eye. He sat dozing in the chair when he was

                cheap perfumes, and medicines for dogs and horses. The villagers
                sat quietly while the peddler ate his supper. They were waiting
                for him to open his box of treasures, which he did once his meal

                Sikes had heard enough. He followed the road out of the village
                with the dog <strong>limping </strong> along behind him. As he
                walked, he felt as though He was being followed. At times he
                stopped to look around, but there was nobody there. Every object
                he saw took on the image of something dreadful. Bill felt a
                ghost following him at every step he took. The thought of
                Nancy’s murdered body <strong> haunted </strong> him always
              </p>

                Bill came to a shed and went in to take shelter for the night,
                but his terror would not allow him to rest. In the darkness he
                saw Nancy’s eyes staring at him; if he shut his eyes, he saw in
                his mind the room, with every object in its place, and the
                girl’s body in its place too. He
                <strong>trembled</strong> in cold sweat until the dawn came at
                last.

                In the cold light of morning, Bill made the decision to return
                to London. He thought that he could hide there easily with the
                <strong> aid </strong>of his friends. “I could remain in hiding
                for a week or two, and force some money out of Fagin. Then I
                could escape to France. It’s worth the risk,” he said to
                himself.

                Mr. Brownlow leapt from his carriage and tapped gently on his
                front door. As the door was opened, two men helped another man
                out of the coach. They hurried the third man inside the house
                between them. Mr. Brownlow led the way upstairs and into a back
                room. The man stopped at the door of the room, not wanting to
                enter.

                Toby Crackit sat with two fellow robbers in a

                The group was discussing Fagin, who had been arrested earlier
                that day. Suddenly a hurried knocking was heard at the door
                downstairs. Toby Crackit looked out the window. They knew who it
                was by the look on Toby’s pale face. Toby went downstairs to the
                door and returned to the room with a man whose face was wrapped
                in scarves. The man removed the scarves to show a tired, worn
                out face, with sunken eyes and three days’ growth of beard. It
                was the very ghost of Bill Sikes.

                Sikes drew up a chair and sat down. He looked from one man to

                silence:

                “Toby,” said Charlie, as Bill’s eyes fell upon him. “Why didn’t

                to be in the same room as Bill Sikes.

                But the struggle was not equal, and Sikes soon had his knee on
                the boy’s throat. Crackit pulled him off and pointed at the
                window. There was a murmur of voices and lights in the darkness;
                footsteps were heard crossing the wooden bridge to the island.
                There was a loud knocking on the door and angry voices called

                Bill Sikes called for a rope, threatening the three men with
                murder if they didn’t get him one. They pointed to where there
                was a Pile of ropes, and Bill took the longest and strongest of
                them. He climbed out of the window and onto the rooftop, looking
                down at the angry crowd. The ditch was empty of water; there was
                only mud to fall into if he jumped.

                The crowd watched silently for a moment as the murderer stood on
                the roof in the darkness. Realizing his intentions, and knowing
                that he would fail, they started shouting again in a roar that
                made their previous noise seem like a whisper.

                Bill Sikes was very frightened by the crowd that waited for him
                below. He had no doubt that if they caught him, he would be
                hanged. He decided to risk being choked to death by mud and to
                drop down into the ditch. He hoped he would be able to blend
                into the darkness and make his escape.

                It was a good plan. With new energy he tied one end of the rope
                to the chimney. At the other end he made a running noose. He
                could then lower himself nearly to the ground, cut the rope with
                his knife, drop into the soft mud and creep away. He put the
                noose over his head and was about to slip it down to his waist,
                when he suddenly saw a terrifying
                <strong>vision</strong>. “The eyes again!” he shouted. In the
                darkness, the image of Nancy’s eyes shown bright and judging
                upon him. Drawing back as if struck by lightning, he lost his
                balance and fell from the roof. He fell thirty-five feet. With a
                sudden jerk, the rope went <strong>taut</strong> and his body
                shook. He hung there, neck broken, with the knife still tightly
                clutched in his lifeless hand.

                among the audience. The jury was brought back into the
                courtroom. Fagin stole a look at his lawyer, but could read

                Monks took his share of the money and set out for the New World,
                where he quickly wasted it and went back to his old criminal
                ways. He ended up in prison where he died. But Charlie Bates,
                shocked at Sikes’s crime, turned his back on his past life and
                became a farmer in the south of England where he lived happily

                Mr. Grimwig and Dr. Losbeme became very good friends. Mr.
                Brownlow often joked with Mr. Grimwig about the night when they
                sat waiting for Oliver’s return. Mr. Grimwig would point out
                that in fact Oliver did not come back, and at this the two men
                would laugh.

                <strong>posts</strong>, though Mr. Giles is bald and Mr. Brittle
                is quite grey. The two divide their attention between both the
