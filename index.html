                Charles Dickens was born on 7th of February 1812 in Portsmouth,
                England. His father was a clerk, unfortunately, he was sent to
                jail for debts when Charles was just a little child.

                Charles went to work at a blacking factory when he was 12, to
                earn money for his family. The harsh living conditions and the
                severe poverty Charles experienced, shaped his thoughts and
                beliefs.

                In 1843, one of Dickens’ most famous works was published – 'A
                Christmas Carol'. In this story, it was particularly clear that
                Dickens was becoming increasingly disappointed with the social
                philosophy of his time

                Dickens travelled abroad in the 1840s, first to America and then
                to Europe. A new stage in his life began. His novels were more
                serious and more carefully planned. ‘David Copperfield’,
                published 1849-50, was similar to the story of Dickens’ own
                life.

                  Charles Dickens wrote a number of great novels, but David
                  Copperfield was his favourite and portrayed his own life, and
                  his miserable childhood after his father was imprisoned.

                I am David Copperfield, and I was born in Blunderstone,

                My mother was rather young when she became a
                <strong> widow </strong>, and the only family I had left was
                Miss Betsey Trotwood, my father’s aunt. Unfortunately, Miss
                Trotwood held strong feelings against my father, having refused

                at the young age of nineteen, had married a man much older than
                her. Even though Greataunt Betsey Trotwood had never met my

                apologising for her youth. "I am <strong>trembling</strong>,"
                cried my mother. "I don’t know what the matter is. I shall die,
                I’m sure I shall die! I’m so frightened" Miss Betsey poured my
                mother some tea and said, I intend to be godmother to your
                daughter.

                My mother nodded. “I was a nursery-governess in a family where
                Mr. Copperfield came to visit. He was very kind to me. He paid
                me a lot of attention. At last he proposed, I accepted and we

                My mother dried her tears and explained that her husband had
                left her a security of one hundred and five pounds a year, which
                was just enough money to live on comfortably. Just then, our

                    My mother and Peggotty were so very different. Mother had
                    pretty hair and a figure like a young girl, while Peggotty
                    was shapeless. Her eyes were very dark and her cheeks and
                    arms were hard and red.

                    crocodiles and was very tired. My eyelids kept closing and I
                    tried to keep them open with my fingers. “Peggotty,” I said

                He accompanied us home from church on a few occasions but I

                We went to a hotel by the sea where Mr. Murdstone met up with

                It was about two months after this trip to Lowestoft that I sat
                watching Peggotty sewing, when she suddenly said, “Master Davy,
                how would you like to come and spend a
                <strong>fortnight</strong> at my brother’s house in Yarmouth?
                You can see the sea and the boats and the ships. You can play

                I knew that Ham was Peggotty’s nephew and I thought the visit
                would be a lot of fun, but I wondered what my mother would say.
                Peggotty said that my mother would be happy for me to go away
                for a little holiday as she was going to spend a
                <strong>fortnight</strong> with a neighbour.

                I woke up filled with excitement and dread as I thought that my
                mother would change her mind. Happily, I was wrong! The day
                dawned clear and bright and I was eager to leave home. I did not
                know that on my return everything would have changed. My mother
                kissed me. goodbye as I climbed onto the carrier’s cart. As I
                looked back and waved, I saw Mr. Murdstone by her side.

                The ride to Yarmouth was long and tiring. We ate from Peggotty’s

                When we arrived in Yarmouth I smelt the fish, the oakum, and the
                tar. I saw the sailors getting ready to go out in their boats.
                Peggotty screamed, “Here’s my Ham!” Ham was a huge, strong man

                Ham said that it was. I was delighted at the thought of staying
                there. Their home was a real boat. It had a roof, a little door
                on the side and little windows. It was very clean inside and as
                tidy as possible, I saw some lockers and boxes, which were used
                for seats.

                smell of fish. Peggotty told me that her brother dealt in

                The days rushed by. Emily and I spent hours and hours walking
                and playing on the beach. “You’re quite a sailor, I suppose?” I
                said to Emily.

                “No,” replied Emily, shaking her head, “I’m afraid of the sea.
                It has been very cruel to some men. I have even seen a ship
                split in half. I never go out on the sea, I don’t even like to

                One morning I went into the parlour with my books and found my
                mother very upset. Standing next to her was a stern-looking Miss
                Murdstone and by her side was Mr. Murdstone with a cane in his
                hand. My stepfather waved his <strong>cane</strong> around as I
                began my lessons. His being there upset me and made me nervous
                so I made many mistakes. With every wrong answer that I gave, my
                mother cried louder.
              </p>

              <p

              >
                Eventually, Mr. Murdstone grabbed my arm and dragged me
                upstairs. I turned to my mother for help. Seeing my distress, my
                mother moved towards me but was stopped by Miss Murdstone, who
                said, “Clara, you are a perfect <strong>fool</strong>!” Mr.
                Murdstone marched me up to my room and once we were inside he
                twisted my head under his arm.
              </p>

              >
                I cried out, “Mr. Murdstone, sir! Please don’t beat me! I have
                tried to learn sir, but I can’t while you and Miss Murdstone are
                in the room. Really, I can’t!”

                Mr. Murdstone ignored my pleas and beat me with his whip. After
                the first lash, I caught his hand between my teeth and bit
                through it. He then beat me as if he wanted to kill me. As he
                left, locking the door behind him, I slipped to the floor
                unconscious.

                Later that night, Miss Murdstone opened the door and gave me
                some bread, meat and milk. She put it on the table and left,
                locking the door behind her. I was a prisoner in my room for
                five days. I was only allowed out of the room to walk in the
                garden for half an hour a day. In my memory, those five days
                seemed like five years.

                On the fifth night, Peggotty came to my door and whispered
                through the keyhole. She told me that I was being sent to a
                <strong> boarding school</strong> near London the following
                morning. “You must never forget me, Davy,” she said. “I know I
                will never forget you. You are my own precious boy and I love
                you. I will take care of your mother, just like I took care of
                you.”

                I whispered back through the door, “Thank you, dear Peggotty.
                Thank you!” The next morning, Miss Murdstone collected me from
                my room and took me to the parlour where my mother sat with red
                eyes and a very pale complexion. I ran to her and she held me in
                her arms until the cart arrived to take me away from everything
                I had known.

                It was the same cart that took Peggotty and I to Yarmouth. I did
                not see Peggotty or Mr. Murdstone before I left.

                Mr. Barkis, the cart-driver, lifted my box onto the cart and I
                climbed in. We had gone half a mile, when the cart stopped. I
                was surprised when Peggotty climbed in and took me in both her
                arms. I couldn’t speak through my tears, as I thought I would
                never see her again, Peggotty didn’t speak, but hugged me close.
                She <strong>slipped</strong> some cakes in my pocket and put a
                purse into my hand. Then, without speaking, she climbed down
                from the cart and hurried away.

                I opened the stiff leather purse and inside saw three bright
                shillings. Besides the coins was a folded piece of paper on
                which my mother had written: “For Davy. With my love.” I started
                to cry again. Mr. Barkis told me to dry my eyes, so I wiped my
                eyes on my sleeve and offered him a cake. Mr. Barkis enjoyed the
                cake and asked if Peggotty had made it.

                “Yes,” I said. “Peggotty makes all our
                <strong>pastries</strong> and does all our cooking.” Mr. Barkis
                then surprised me by asking if Peggotty was married. “Oh, no.
                She’s never been married,” I replied quickly.

                For some reason, Mr. Barkis appeared happy at this news and
                asked me if I wrote letters to her. When I nodded that I did, he
                asked me to give her a message. He said that I was to tell
                Peggotty that “Barkis is willing.” “That Barkis is
                <strong>willing</strong>,” I repeated. “Is that all the
                message?”

                <strong>stepfather</strong> and I didn’t know which name he
                used. A friendly waiter who asked me where I was going showed me
                into a large room and served chops and vegetables. “To school,”
                I replied through a <strong>mouthful</strong> of food. “Near
                London,” which was all I knew about my
                <strong>destination</strong>.

                We left Yarmouth at three o’clock in the afternoon. We were due
                to arrive in London at eight o’clock the following morning. I
                was squashed between two gentlemen and opposite a tall, elderly

                short of space, pushed it under my short legs. I was cramped and

                My days were long and boring and I was lonely and homesick.
                Every day I did my lessons with Mr. Mell, who was quite but
                kind. Before and after my lessons I walked about, accompanied by
                the man with the wooden leg. At one o’clock I ate lunch with Mr.
                Mell and then had more lessons until teatime.

                We finished our lessons at seven o’clock and then Mr. Mell took

                I had lived like this for about a month when Mr. Mell told me
                that Mr. Creakle would be returning to the school. The man with
                the wooden leg cleaned the schoolroom with a mop and bucket in
                preparation for the owner’s return. Later that night I was taken

                Creakle could see the sign on my back.

                Steerforth sat on my pillow and I sat on the floor and the other
                boys grouped themselves around us on the beds and on the floor.
                We ate the feast quickly, leaving nothing for the following day.

                The boys told me about Mr. Creakle. They said that he was the
                <strong>sternest</strong> and severest of masters and liked to
                hit the boys. Steerforth said that Mr. Creakle never punished
                him. I learnt that the man with the wooden leg, whose name was
                Tungay, had been in business with Mr. Creakle and had arrived at
                the school with the <strong>principal</strong>.

                “Goodnight, young Copperfield,” said Steerforth as we made ready
                for bed. “I’ll take care of you. You’re a very kind boy and I
                thank you for the feast.”

                “Goodnight, sir,” I replied sleepily. I thought about Steerforth
                after I had climbed into my bed. He was a person of great power
                and he looked very <strong>handsome</strong> in the moonlight
                with his head laying over one arm.

                School began the next day. The loud voices in the schoolroom
                suddenly became quiet when Mr. Creakle entered. He stood in the
                <strong>doorway</strong> looking round upon us like a master

                not. You will be severely punished and you won’t be able to rub

                where I was sat and showed me his cane. He told me that it was
                famous for biting too, and brought the cane down on my hand. I
                cried out in pain.

                Traddles was an honourable boy and thought it was our duty to
                stand by one another and had often suffered because of it. Once
                Steerforth had laughed in church, but it was Traddles who was

                Traddles did not tell Mr. Creakle who had really laughed and the

                Traddles was a good friend and Traddles was happy with these
                words of praise.

                I believe that no man had ever enjoyed his
                <strong>profession</strong> more than Mr. Creakle. He delighted
                in hitting and marking the boys, especially the younger ones. I
                remember the look in his eye when he was hitting the boys and
                then watching them try to rub away the marks with their
                handkerchiefs.

                One good thing came of my beatings. Mr. Creakle realised that my

                so it was taken off and I did not have to wear it again

                Sometimes at night, before we fell asleep, I told stories to
                Steerforth which he really seemed to enjoy. The more imaginative
                and impossible, the better. One day I received a wonderful
                letter from Peggotty, together with a cake in a perfect nest of
                oranges. I laid this feast at Steerforth’s feet and asked him to
                share it out to the boys in our room.

                In a school carried on by sheer cruelty, it was very difficult
                to <strong>concentrate</strong> on learning. Most of the boys
                were very <strong>ignorant</strong>
                because they were always worried and afraid of being beaten.
                With Steerforth’s help, I made use of my time at Salem House and
                managed to learn quite a lot of useful information, despite the
                loneliness and the cruelty of the school.

                I was very pleased when I was with Mr. Mell. He liked me and
                taught a lot of subjects. I am sad when I remember how rudely
                Steerforth treated him and encouraged other boys to do so. This
                troubled me a lot, especially as I had told Steerforth about the
                old woman that Mr. Mell had taken me to see.

                I was always afraid that Steerforth would mention this visit and

                Creakle was absent, there was a lot of noise coming from the

                out of their seats, making faces and mimicking Mr. Mell’s

                that my mother and Mr. Murdstone had come to visit me. At first
                I saw nobody in the room, but as I looked behind the door, I saw
                to my amazement, Ham and Mr. Peggotty standing there. We shook
                hands and laughed, happy to see each other again.

                turned to walk away, but I called after him, “Don’t go,
                Steerforth. I would like to introduce you. These are two

                She was looking into his face and singing. Nobody had written to
                tell me that I had a baby brother.

                My mother seemed happy to see me and called me her dear Davy,
                her own boy. She came across the room to meet me and kissed me.

                Peggotty came running in and sat down between us. We were so
                happy together. Mr. and Miss Murdstone were out for the evening
                and so the three of us ate dinner in the kitchen. I felt so
                happy there. I told Peggotty about Mr. Barkis, which made her

                I looked at my mother as she ate. She was still very pretty, but

                Later that night, I read Peggotty a chapter out of the Crocodile

                wheels. All three of us got up and my mother sent me off to bed

                morning, as I had not seen Mr. Murdstone since the day I left

                myself in the parlour. Mr. Murdstone was standing with his back
                to the fire and Miss Murdstone was making the tea.

                He did not show any sign of recognition so I went to him and

                I told her the holidays were a month long. Miss Murdstone was
                very unhappy at this news. She kept a calendar of the holidays
                and every morning checked a day off. When she got to ten days,
                she seemed much happier. It was on this day that I took the baby
                from my mother’s lap. I held him very carefully in my arms. Miss

                My holiday dragged along like this until at last the morning
                arrived when Miss Murdstone said, “Here’s the last day checked
                off!” She was very happy that I was going back to school.

                I was not sorry to go back to school. I looked forward to seeing
                Steerforth and Traddles and was quite delighted when I saw Mr.
                Barkis appear at the gate and pick up my box. I kissed my mother
                and my baby brother goodbye and my mother hugged me like she did
                not want me to leave.

                I returned to school and nothing much happened until my tenth
                birthday. I was called to Mr. Creakle’s parlour by Mr. Sharp. I
                was expecting a <strong>hamper</strong> from Peggotty and walked
                swiftly to receive my birthday present. I found Mr. Creakle
                sitting eating breakfast in the parlour with his cane and a
                newspaper in front of him. Mrs. Creakle was in the parlour with
                a letter in her hand, but no hamper.

                “David Copperfield,” said Mrs. Creakle, leading me to a sofa and
                sitting down beside me. “I want to speak to you. I have
                something to tell you, my child. You are too young to know about
                death, but it is something we all have to deal with, David.”

                I left Salem House the next afternoon. We travelled slowly and
                did not arrive in Yarmouth until ten o’clock the next morning.
                Mr. Barkis and his cart were not there to meet me and I
                travelled home with a stranger.

                I was in Peggotty’s arms before I got to the door of the house.
                She was crying, but controlled it and spoke to me in whispers.
                Miss Murdstone <strong>ignored </strong> me completely when I
                went into the parlour. Mr. Murdstone did not

                On the day of the <strong>funeral</strong> we stood around the
                graveside, bareheaded, listening to the voice of the clergyman.
                Then the earth was piled on top of my mother’s coffin. I held
                Peggotty’s hand as she sobbed and we turned away from the grave
                and walked back to the house.

                That night, Peggotty came to my room. She sat on my bed and held
                my hand. “She wasn’t well,” she said. “Not for a long time, not
                since your baby brother was born. I thought at first that she
                would get better, but she became more delicate and frail every

                Miss Murdstone was now mistress of the house and the first thing

                Peggotty decided to go to Yarmouth for a fortnight and I was

                it was a quiet journey for all of us. Mr. Peggotty and Ham were
                waiting for us. I jumped down from the cart and left Peggotty

                At half past twelve on my first day, Mr. Quinion tapped the
                window and told me to follow him. He introduced me to a stout,
                middle-aged man with a <strong>bald</strong> head and a large
                smiling face.

                His clothes were very shabby. “This is Mr. Micawber,” said Mr.
                Quinion to me. “Mr. Micawber is a friend of Mr. Murdstone. You
                are to be a lodger in his house.”

                Mr. Micawber told me his address and then offered to come back
                at eight o’clock to collect me. After he had left, Mr. Quinion
                paid me my first salary of six shillings a week, in advance.

                Mr. Micawber arrived at eight o’clock as promised and took me to
                his home. He introduced me to Mrs. Micawber, a thin woman with a
                baby in her arms. There were two other children in the room, a
                boy and a girl, aged about three and four. Mrs. Micawber showed
                me to my room at the top of the house. It was very small and
                badly furnished.

                Mrs. Micawber then told me about Mr. Micawber being in financial
                difficulties. “If Mr. Micawber’s creditors will not give him
                time,” said Mrs. Micawber, “they must accept the
                <strong>consequences</strong>. You cannot get blood from a
                stone.” Mr. Micawber’s creditors visited the house at all hours
                of the day and night. They were quite angry and banged on the
                door loudly.

                I passed my leisure time in this house with this family. My own
                breakfast of a penny loaf and a penny worth of milk, I bought
                and paid for myself. In a small cupboard, I kept another small
                loaf and a small piece of cheese for my dinner when I came home
                from work.

                My six shillings did not last long and I often would buy myself
                a stale pastry for half-price on my way to work. I was young and
                inexperienced and should have kept the money to buy my lunch. I
                did not know how to make my money last a whole week.

                When I wrote to Peggotty I did not tell her of my miserable
                existence. I did not want to worry her. A friendship formed
                between the Micawbers and myself, even though they were adults
                and I was just a child. One morning Mrs. Micawber came to me and
                said, “Master Copperfield, you are no stranger and I feel I can
                tell you about our difficulties. Apart from a bit of cheese,
                there is nothing to eat in the house.”

                I was very uncomfortable with this information and offered Mrs.
                Micawber the two or three shillings that I still had in my
                pocket. Mrs. Micawber kissed me and told me to put the money
                back in my pocket.

                “No, my dear Master Copperfield,” she said. “I cannot take your
                money, but you can do something for me if you don’t mind.” She
                asked me to take some of the valuable items she still had to the
                pawnbroker and borrow money against them. I agreed to help her
                and did so regularly for some time until Mr. Micawber’s
                difficulties came to a <strong>crisis</strong>. He went bankrupt
                and was arrested early one morning.

                On the first Sunday after the arrest, I went to visit Mr.
                Micawber. I ate with him in his little room and stayed for the
                afternoon. I went home and told Mrs. Micawber of my visit.
                Gradually, everything in the Micawber house was sold to help the
                family and eventually Mrs. Micawber decided to move into the
                prison with Mr. Micawber. I rented a little room, close to the
                prison so that I could visit the Micawbers as they were still
                responsible for me.

                The next morning, I saw the whole family off on the coach to
                Plymouth. I decided that I did not want to work at the warehouse
                anymore and planned to run away. I would go to the country and
                tell my story to my aunt, Miss Betsey Trotwood. I don’t know how
                or why I thought of this plan and I did not know where she
                lived, but I wrote to Peggotty and begged for a half-guinea. I

                Peggotty’s reply, with the half-guinea, arrived quickly. She

                the exact address. I decided to leave at the end of the week and
                managed to find a man with a donkey cart who agreed to take me
                by road to the Dover coach office for a few pennies.

                pennies in my pocket. My experience with the Micawbers was very

                lonely feeling of lying down without a roof over my head. At
                first light I crept away just as Mr. Creakle’s boys were getting
                up and I began my long, dusty way to Dover. That Sunday I walked
                23 miles, arriving in Rochester hungry and tired. I didn’t want
                to spend the little money I had, so I spent another night under
                the stars. I walked about 20 miles a day, buying bread and
                sleeping rough outside. When my money ran out I went to a shop
                to sell my jacket. A dreadful, dirty old man was standing in a
                <strong>grubby</strong> shop.

                He seized me by the hair and I handed over my jacket. “Oh, how
                much do you want for the jacket?” he asked.

                I agreed, as I was anxious to end the argument. He then tried to
                persuade me to exchange my jacket for a fishing rod or a fiddle.
                I told him that I wanted the money. At last he began to pay me,
                a half penny at a time. When I got outside I realised that he
                had paid me four pence less than the agreed price. I spent three
                pence on some food and drink and <strong>limped</strong> along
                the road on my way to Dover.

                I spoke to many people before a kind man said, “Trotwood. Let me

                I said that my aunt was very old. The man pointed and said, “Go
                that way, until you come to some houses facing the sea. She
                lives somewhere there. You may not find her very kind, so here

                I accepted the coin thankfully and bought a loaf of bread with
                it. I walked until I came to the houses facing the sea and went
                into a shop to ask if anyone knew where Miss Trotwood lived.
                Inside was a young woman buying rice. She turned and looked at
                me, saying, “Miss Trotwood is my mistress. What do you want with
                her, boy?”

                My aunt’s maid walked out of the shop, telling me to follow her.
                We arrived at a neat cottage with a small garden, full of
                flowers. “This is Miss Trotwood’s house,” said the maid. I
                looked down at myself. My shoes were in very bad condition, I
                had no jacket or waistcoat and my hat was
                <strong>crushed</strong> and bent. My shirt and trousers were
                dirty and worn. I felt very nervous as I waited to introduce
                myself to my aunt.

                My aunt came out of the house wearing gardening gloves and
                waving a large knife in one hand. “Go away,” she cried. “Go
                away! No boys here.” I held my hat in my hand. “Please, madam,”
                I began. “Please, aunt.” Miss Trotwood looked up in surprise.

                “I am your nephew,” I stammered. My aunt sat down on the garden
                path in shock. “I am David Copperfield of Blunderstone in
                Suffolk. You came there the night I was born and saw my mother.
                I have been very unhappy since she died. I have been neglected
                and sent out to work. I have only a little education and I have
                run away to you. I was <strong>robbed</strong> and have walked
                the entire way. I haven’t slept in a bed since I began my

                My aunt got up quickly and took me into her house. She put me on
                her sofa with a shawl under my head and a handkerchief under my
                feet to keep it clean. She then rang the bell and called for
                Janet, the serving girl. “Go upstairs and ask Mr. Dick to come

                bathing, my aunt found me a pair of trousers and a shirt
                belonging to Mr. Dick. When I was clean and dressed, I lay down
                on the sofa and fell asleep. When I woke up, I looked around the
                neat room. We sat down to an excellent dinner and all the time I

                So I was taken to bed. I noticed that there were no clothes in
                the room and as I said goodnight and climbed into bed, I thought
                that my aunt might think that I would run away again. My room
                was at the top of the house overlooking the sea and as I drifted
                off to sleep, I thought of all the lonely nights I had spent
                under the stars. I prayed that I might never be
                <strong>homeless</strong> again.

                The next morning, I joined my aunt for breakfast. As I was

                My aunt told me that Mr. Dick’s real name was Mr. Richard
                Babley, but he disliked the name so much that he would not
                answer to anything but Mr. Dick. Mr. Dick and I became friends.
                I learnt that he was a distant <strong>cousin</strong> of my aunt’s. I remember

                Later that night Bill hurried Oliver through the damp, foggy
                streets. Through muddy fields and narrow lanes they went, Bill
                pushing Oliver along in front of him. They came to a house in
                disrepair. Toby Crackit opened the door to them. He was
                surprised to see Oliver and demanded to know who he was. Toby
                poured them both a drink while Bill Sikes explained about the

                The two robbers held Oliver between them as they left the house
                and disappeared into the darkness and <strong>mist</strong>.
                They crossed a small bridge into the town of Chertsey and
                stopped by a high wall surrounding a large house. Toby climbed
                over the wall, and Sikes lifted Oliver up and helped him over to
                where Toby waited. Sikes followed closely behind. The three of
                them lay on the grass as they caught their breath. Oliver looked
                around him and realized what the two men needed from him—that he
                was needed to <strong>partake</strong> in a
                <strong>housebreaking</strong>, robbery and possibly murder. A
                cold sweat came over him, and he fell to his knees.

                “Get up!” demanded Sikes. “Or the earth will be covered in your
                brains.” Oliver gathered his strength and rose to his feet.
                “Please let me go,” he cried. “Let me run away and die in the
                fields. I will never come near London again. Don’t make me

                Sikes would have fired the pistol but Toby knocked it from his
                hand. “Hush,” Toby whispered to Oliver. “Say another word and
                I’ll knock you down with a crack on the head. It’s quieter than
                a gunshot but does the same job.”

                the window open and shined the lantern in Oliver’s face. “Now

                Oliver was frightened by the cry and let the lantern fall to the
                floor with a crash. Immediately a light appeared at the top of
                the stairs, and Oliver saw two frightened men peering around the
                doorway. Suddenly there was a flash, a bang, smoke and a crash
                somewhere.

                Sikes was behind Oliver, grabbing him by the collar as the smoke
                cleared away. Bill fired his pistol at the men as he ran to the
                window, dragging Oliver behind him. Oliver heard a loud bell
                ringing, the noise of gunfire and the shouts of men. He
                <strong>sensed</strong> he was being carried away quickly. He
                felt sick and cold, then all went dark and he heard nothing.

                Not far from the house, Bill dropped Oliver into a dry
                <strong>ditch</strong>. Oliver was bleeding heavily. Bill could
                hear men shouting in the distance and the sound of barking dogs
                as they made their way closer. He took another look at Oliver,
                jumped out of the ditch and ran into the night leaving Oliver
                behind.

                Three men stopped to listen. They called back the dogs and the
                air went suddenly silent. The three pursuers gathered together
                to discuss their plan of action. Two of the men were servants in
                the big house; the third man was a <strong>tinker</strong> who
                had joined in the chase when he heard the commotion. They were

                Oliver lay unconscious in the ditch, feeling nothing as the rain
                beat down on him. As dawn broke over him he awoke, shivering in
                cold and pain. The bleeding had stopped, but his left arm hung
                useless at his side. He climbed painfully out of the ditch and
                staggered towards a narrow road. In the distance, he saw a house
                and slowly walked towards it. He carefully climbed the steps,
                knocked faintly on the door and collapsed against the doorway.

                Inside, the three men, who had chased the
                <strong>intruders</strong> in the night, sat in the warm
                kitchen, where they told their tale to both the cook and the
                housemaid. Of course, to make the tale more interesting to the
                two females, Mr. Giles—the servant—exaggerated the facts so that
                he and his colleague, Mr. Brittles, looked like heroes.

                “Who could be knocking on the door so early in the morning?” he
                said, as he looked at the pale, frightened faces around him at
                the table. Mr. Giles looked quite pale as well. “But the door

                None of the party made any moves toward the door. After much
                discussion Mr. Brittles agreed to open the door, but only with
                Mr. Giles and the tinker as witnesses. They went upstairs to the
                front door. The two women didn’t want to be left behind so they
                followed the men, talking very loudly to make it seem that there
                were more people in the house than there really were. Mr. Giles
                told the others to pinch the dogs’ tails so as to make them bark
                <strong>viciously</strong>. As Mr. Brittles opened the door, the
                four other members of the welcoming committee looked over his
                shoulder to see who had disturbed their breakfast. What they saw
                was an <strong>exhausted</strong>, injured David Copperfield.

                <strong> frequented </strong> by various sorts of criminals. He

                He looked from face to face, searching for someone. Finally

                After ordering a drink from the landlord, he passed through the
                bar and into the little parlour. The lonely customer was sitting
                at a small table, bending over his drink. Mr. Bumble muttered a
                greeting as he passed the man, but there was no reply.

                The following evening, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble made their way

                A small door opened at the side of the building and Monks waved

                sit down on chairs that were

                The next evening, as Bill Sikes was drinking himself to sleep,
                he looked at Nancy’s face. He was surprised to see how pale she

                Nancy had no choice but to obey. Sikes held her hand as he lay
                down on the pillows. His eyes closed and he fell into a deep,
                drug- induced sleep. Nancy gathered up her<strong>

                crash, and fell back in his chair. Mr. Brownlow was also very
                surprised, but he did not express his amazement in the same
                strange fashion.

                As Fagin’ walked home in the early hours of the morning, he
                thought about Nancy’s strange behaviour. It seemed odd that she
                would be so impatient to leave home at eleven o’clock, only to
                give up the struggle at exactly twelve o’clock. He thought that
                maybe Nancy had found a new friend and was going to leave Bill.
                A new friend of Nancy’s would be valuable to Fagin, so he
                decided to have her watched.

                The following Sunday night, the church clock struck
                quarter-to-twelve as two <strong>figures</strong> appeared on
                London Bridge. One was a woman who was looking about, as if in
                search of something. The other figure walked in the shadows, not
                wanting to be seen as he followed the woman. When she reached
                the other side of the bridge, the woman looked around her again.
                There was no sign of anyone else there so she turned back. Her
                shadow stopped and turned back as well.

                The shadow saw a young lady and an older gentleman climb out of
                a carriage and then <strong>dismiss</strong> it. They walked
                towards the bridge. Nancy saw them and ran to join them. She
                pointed to the steps and said that she would speak to them
                there. The shadow watched them, hidden in the shadows, and had
                to pull himself back as they stopped in front of him

                given up for you, just tonight. You can’t have the heart to kill

                He freed one of his arms from her grip and pulled out his
                pistol. He realized it was too dangerous to fire the weapon, so

                horrible scene, with light. As terrible a scene as it had been

                He lit a fire and threw the murder weapon into the flames. Then
                he washed himself and tried to rub the blood spots off of his
                clothes. Some
                <strong> stains</strong> could not be removed, so he cut out
                those pieces of cloth and burnt them. Blood stains were all
                around the room. Even Bull’s- eye’s feet were bloody.

                Late that evening, having walked all day, Bill found a
                <strong> public-house </strong>
                in a small village. There were some villagers quietly drinking
                their ale before the fire. They made room for the stranger but
                he ignored them and sat alone, except for his dog, in the
                farthest corner of the room. He ordered food and drink, which he
                shared with Bull’s-eye. He sat dozing in the chair when he was
                startled awake by a newcomer to the pub.

                The man was a travelling <strong> peddler. </strong> On his back
                was a box of his with treasures for sale, among them razors,
                cheap perfumes, and medicines for dogs and horses. The villagers
                sat quietly while the peddler ate his supper. They were waiting
                for him to open his box of treasures, which he did once his meal
                was finished.

                The villagers sat as the peddler showed his wares. One man

                Sikes had heard enough. He followed the road out of the village
                with the dog <strong>limping </strong> along behind him. As he
                walked, he felt as though He was being followed. At times he
                stopped to look around, but there was nobody there. Every object
                he saw took on the image of something dreadful. Bill felt a
                ghost following him at every step he took. The thought of
                Nancy’s murdered body <strong> haunted </strong> him always
              </p>

                Bill came to a shed and went in to take shelter for the night,
                but his terror would not allow him to rest. In the darkness he
                saw Nancy’s eyes staring at him; if he shut his eyes, he saw in
                his mind the room, with every object in its place, and the
                girl’s body in its place too. He
                <strong>trembled</strong> in cold sweat until the dawn came at
                last.

                In the cold light of morning, Bill made the decision to return
                to London. He thought that he could hide there easily with the
                <strong> aid </strong>of his friends. “I could remain in hiding
                for a week or two, and force some money out of Fagin. Then I
                could escape to France. It’s worth the risk,” he said to
                himself.

                Mr. Brownlow leapt from his carriage and tapped gently on his
                front door. As the door was opened, two men helped another man
                out of the coach. They hurried the third man inside the house
                between them. Mr. Brownlow led the way upstairs and into a back

                lock the door from the outside. They were only to unlock it when

                Mr. Brownlow offered fifty pounds more to the
